The object of the game is to collect more points that your opponent.
- The pellets grant you **1 point**
- The strawberries grant you **3 Points** and give you the ability to shoot

Every level also has at least one computer squid moving aroung. Touching it will stun you for a short period of time, so avoid them if possible.

When you collect a strawberry, a gauge will fill up next to your score. Press the shoot key, to fire a strawberry in the dirrection you are currently going. Hitting your opponent will stun them. You can't stun the computer squids in any way.

Once all pellets and strawberries are collected, a portal will open up. When one of the players touch it, the next level will begin.

There are 3 levels in total. Once you finish the 3rd level, the game ends and whoever got the most points is declared the winner.
